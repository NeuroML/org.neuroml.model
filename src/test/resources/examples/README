Note the primary source of these files is the repository:
https://github.com/NeuroML/NeuroML2

There should be some way to automatically pull/sync these from there, but for now they
will be manually updated and so will be available for use/testing here and in the 
other Maven based NeuroML/LEMS Java projects
