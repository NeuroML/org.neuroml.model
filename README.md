NeuroML V1 Model JAVA API
=========================

NeuroML is an international, collaborative initiative to develop standards for the exchange of models of neuronal systems and to allow for greater transparency and accessibility of these complex models.

This JAVA library is a work in progress aimed at providing a programmatic way to access models stored in NeuroML version 1.

More details can be found on the official [NeuroML website](http://www.neuroml.org).

A collection of models in NeuroML can be found at [Open Source Brain](http://www.opensourcebrain.org).
