NeuroML is an international, collaborative initiative to develop standards for the exchange of models of neuronal
systems and to allow for greater transparency and accessibility of these complex models.

This Java library is  aimed at providing a programmatic way to access models stored in NeuroML version 2.

As an example of what's possible, see [here](https://github.com/NeuroML/org.neuroml.model/blob/master/src/test/java/org/neuroml/model/test/NeuroML2Test.java).

More details about NeuroML can be found on the official [NeuroML website](http://www.neuroml.org).

A collection of models in NeuroML can be found on the [Open Source Brain](http://www.opensourcebrain.org) repository.
